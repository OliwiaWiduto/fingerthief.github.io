     <h4>Research</h4>
     <p><b>Code / </b>To understand the possibilities of Arduino, we spent 3 months
       completing software challenges, online tutorials & reading about the hardware.
   <br></br>
   <b>Gadget / </b>We took a hard look at the technological market to find there are
   many ways to keep track of physical health, but next to none when it comes to
   mental health. From there, we delved into wearables which focused on hedonism.
   Our project had never been made before, but with a little imagination we combined
   a basic health monitor with LED eyeshadow.

 <br></br>
     <h4>Process</h4>
     <p><b>Time / </b>This project was extremely pushed for time therefore required a
       strict schedule with intense research & learning.</p>

  <p><b>Problem Solving / </b>Due to the steep learning curve, with 0 previous
    experience the project hit walls daily. We had to be extremely persistent and
    creative to overcome the constant challenges.</p>

  <p><b>Sewing / </b>I was able to show off my sewing & embroidery skills in making
    the casing for our wearable.</p>


     <h4>Reflection</h4>
     <p><b>Discovery / </b>This was my first taste of university-level coding.
       Not only can I write basic code in Arduino as well as Processing, I’m also able
       to output it to LED and sound!
       <br></br>
       <b>Improvements /</b> To ensure it is in full working order, we had to keep
    this project very minimal. I would love nothing more than to develop it with an
    array of high tech sensors.</p>

     <h4>Research</h4>
     <p><b>Story /</b> Having lived in Scotland for a month, the first step of this
       project was researching Scottish folklore. I concentrated on stories which were
        already slightly popular so I could build on my audience’s curiosity, but not
        so popular that I breaking down century old stereotypes, forcing my audience
        into cognitive dissonance.
        <br></br><b>Style /</b> I studied various animation styles until I found the
        most fitting in terms of appeasing my target audience. I wanted realism but a
        style simple enough to be produced at low cost for distributors such as Adult
        Swim. As a family movie, I needed the show to carry strong morals and unravel
        like an allegory. Amy Sherman-Palladino, creator of cult show “Gilmore Girls”,
        names this as the success of her show. </p>

    <h4>Process</h4>
      <p>
    <b>Art / </b>Photos and sketches are key. For inspiration I used Pinterest, & the stunning architecture of Edinburgh. Its metropolitan tweaks helped me create a modern spin on ancient lore. The lead, Gaudy was designed to draw in mothers who would put the show on. The relatable b-list characters would entice the rest of the family to keep watching.

    <p><b>Discovery / </b>1 week to draw 40 frames - the main skill I learned was speed drawing!
    <br></br><b>Improvements / </b>In retrospect I wish I’d done this project in illustrator, as is the industry standard. I also wish I made better use of colour as a means of wayfinding.

    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p><b>Reference / </b>The research aspect of this project was extremely hands on:
      I asked Dalry Swim Centre if I could come in and take photos to base sketches on.
       <br></br>
       <b>Style / </b> In figuring out the style, I compiled a moodboard on Pinterest and analysed
       movies of similar styles such as the works of Daniel Gies.

  <h4>Process</h4>
  <p><b>Character Design / </b>The high detail illustration meant endless hours of
    tedious drawing. It was very important to break down each character limb by limb
    so I could animate complicated movement such as swimming, using one drawing.
     <br></br>
     <b>Animation / </b> Similarly, I paid attention to the most intricate of details
     to give the characters’ movements realism which complemented the textured style.

     cycles. Throughout my animation these looks unnatural, breaking the immersive
     illusion.

    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p><b>Idea / </b>To create my prototype, I studied sustainability in an attempt to

      technologies currently being researched, created and funded across the world.
       <br></br>
       <b>App / </b>To visualise the app, I carried out a 20-in-20 exercise, followed by
       a lot of sketching, colour & design studies.

  <h4>Process</h4>
  <p><b>Mock Up / </b>This prototype was fully made in Axure. I found the program to
    have a much steeper learning curve that InVision but rarely arrived at dead ends.
    With a lot of googling and processes which I was shocked to find hadn’t been automated
     yet, I mocked up Gardenshare within 1 month.
     <br></br>
     <b>Feedback / </b> To visualise the app, I carried out a 20-in-20 exercise, followed

  <div class="third-para">
  <h4>Reflection</h4>
  <p><b>Discovery / </b>I used Axure programme as UX researchers at Napier University
    had done substantial studies showing it is more beneficial to learn as compared
    with InVision. In retrospect, in terms of designing and showcasing I believe the
    latter is much better and will definitely be using it in the future.
     <br></br>
     <b>Improvements / </b> Too often my users were unaware of functions and didn’t
     know how to move on to the next step. Garden Share definitely needs critical way
     finding improvements through captions and buttons.
